# POMOmusics-Project
POMOmusics is a python GUI that combines Pomodoro technology and a music player. Pomodoro technology is a popular time management method. Music activates both the left and right brain simultaneously, and activating both hemispheres can maximize learning and improve memory. Also, music can help people perform better in times of high stress. So combining Pomodoro with music helps to manage time in high-stress situations.
