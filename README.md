# POMOmusics-Project
POMOmusics is a python GUI that combines Pomodoro technology and a music player. Pomodoro technology is a popular time management method. Music activates both the left and right brain simultaneously, and activating both hemispheres can maximize learning and improve memory. Also, music can help people perform better in times of high stress. So combining Pomodoro with music helps to manage time in high-stress situations.

### How Pomodoro works
For one Pomodoro, you need to work on the task for 25 minutes and take a short break of five minutes. After four of these Pomodoros (after four repetitions), you can take a 30 minutes break.
